# bigsur

Hello
I’m no programmer or code writer but myself and many other are having issues with Big Sur on M1 Macs with external displays…wasn’t sure if you’d be able to help.
There is a discussion here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252072263?answerId=254084621022&replyId=254084621022
But simply put, at start up or wake, the screens flicker.
The only way to fix it is to go to system preferences, display and change the refresh rate from 60 to 50 then back to 60…also the monitors have to be put back in order.
I’m not that smart about this stuff but it seems that a preference file is not being saved at restart…
Thoughts?
Thanks!!
